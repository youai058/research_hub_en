# FrugalRAG: Less is More in RL Finetuning for Multi-hop Question Answering

## Abstract
Reinforcement learning (RL) based on the final answer's reward has driven recent progress in small language models (SLMs) on reasoning-heavy tasks such as math and code. However, applying the same techniques to retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) benchmarks like multi-hop QA has yielded limited gains—often trailing supervised or prompting-only baselines. Instead, we argue that a viable path for RL in multi-hop QA is to use test-time scaling judiciously, for optimizing both the final answer accuracy and the efficiency in reaching that answer. 
We propose FrugalRAG, a two-stage finetuning framework that adaptively _reduces_ the number of retrieval steps based on a question's difficulty. First, we train an SLM with supervised finetuning on a full-exploration policy that generates broad sub-queries. Then, we apply RL to adaptively prune search depth based on question difficulty, directly rewarding policies that balance correctness with frugality. Unlike prior approaches requiring 10× more data, our method achieves competitive performance with only ~1,000 examples. On HotPotQA and other multi-hop QA benchmarks, FrugalRAG attains state-of-the-art efficiency–accuracy tradeoffs, cutting retrieval cost nearly in half.  Moreover, on the challenging BrowseCompPlus benchmark, it generalizes zero-shot and surpasses SLM-based and other baselines. These results demonstrate the use of RL—not to increase reasoning steps but to reduce them—as an effective solution for scalable, efficient RAG.
