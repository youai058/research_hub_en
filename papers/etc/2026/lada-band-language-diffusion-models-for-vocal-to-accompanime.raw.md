# LaDA-Band: Language Diffusion Models for Vocal-to-Accompaniment Generation

## Abstract
Vocal-to-accompaniment (V2A) generation, which aims to transform a raw vocal recording into a fully arranged accompaniment, inherently requires jointly addressing an accompaniment trilemma: preserving acoustic authenticity, maintaining global coherence with the vocal track, and producing dynamic orchestration across a full song. Existing open-source approaches typically make compromises among these goals. Continuous-latent generation models can capture long musical spans but often struggle to preserve fine-grained acoustic detail. In contrast, discrete autoregressive models retain local fidelity but suffer from unidirectional generation and error accumulation in extended contexts. We present LaDA-Band, an end-to-end framework that introduces Discrete Masked Diffusion to the V2A task. Our approach formulates V2A generation as Discrete Masked Diffusion, i.e., a global, non-autoregressive denoising formulation that combines the representational advantages of discrete audio codec tokens with full-sequence bidirectional context modeling. This design improves long-range structural consistency and temporal synchronization while preserving crisp acoustic details. Built on this formulation, LaDA-Band further introduces a dual-track prefix-conditioning architecture, an auxiliary replaced-token detection objective for weakly anchored accompaniment regions, and a two-stage progressive curriculum to scale Discrete Masked Diffusion to full-song vocal-to-accompaniment generation. Extensive experiments on both academic and real-world benchmarks show that LaDA-Band consistently improves acoustic authenticity, global coherence, and dynamic orchestration over existing baselines, while maintaining strong performance even without auxiliary reference audio.
