# LLaDA2.0: Scaling Up Diffusion Language Models to 100B

## Abstract
This paper presents LLaDA2.0 -- a tuple of discrete diffusion large language models (dLLM) scaling up to 100B total parameters through systematic conversion from auto-regressive (AR) models -- establishing a new paradigm for frontier-scale deployment. Instead of costly training from scratch, LLaDA2.0 upholds knowledge inheritance, progressive adaption and efficiency-aware design principle, and seamless converts a pre-trained AR model into dLLM with a novel 3-phase block-level WSD based training scheme: progressive increasing block-size in block diffusion (warm-up), large-scale full-sequence diffusion (stable) and reverting back to compact-size block diffusion (decay). Along with post-training alignment with SFT and DPO, we obtain LLaDA2.0-mini (16B) and LLaDA2.0-flash (100B), two instruction-tuned Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) variants optimized for practical deployment. By preserving the advantages of parallel decoding, these models deliver superior performance and efficiency at the frontier scale. Both models were open-sourced.
